            <h1>What is "yosakoi"?</h1>
            <p>
                Yosakoi (yo-sa-coy) is a festival dance originating from Kochi Prefecture, Japan in the 1950s. The festival and dance were created to
                help bolster the economy of the area.  Now, the original choreography is learned in schools across Japan, and there are many festivals held, 
                both large and small in scale.  Teams may participate for prizes at each.<br><br>
                The dance, at its core, incorporates wooden clackers called 'naruko'. While the dance orginally had specific steps along a single song, with each year
                more and more styles are incorporated into the festivals, leading to a rainbow of energy vibrating each festival to its core.<br><br>
                With this website, I hope you can learn a bit about yosakoi, the festivals, and even how to participate!<br><br>
