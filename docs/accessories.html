            <h1>How can I put together a Yosakoi Costume?</h1>
            <p>
                So you want to put together your own yosakoi team - great! The good news is that costumes 
                can be just about anything you can imagine - essential accessories are very few and with the 
                right guidance easy enough to access.

                Most yosakoi dance groups wear <em>tabi</em>, shoes with a spit toe (think ninja). In Japan, tabi are worn by many folks, most especially
                construction workers for the better balance they allow. Nowadays businesses are taking notice of the stability offered by these shoes and selling
                their own split-toe shoes, but beware! Yosakoi is a dance intended to be done at festivals and on streets, and may feature jumping as part of the
                choreography. A pair of "tabi clogs" or "tabi sandals" are simply not going to work here. What is needed is a sturdy pair of canvas, ankle-high 
                or higher, rubber-soled tabi shoes - or better yet, a pair of sneaker-like tabi featuring shock-absorbing soles.<br><br>

                <a href="https://samuraimarket.net/collections/tabi-shoes">Samurai Market</a> offers exactly the shoes needed in their Tabi Shoes section.
                The Marugo Air Jog tabi are a bit spendy, but feature an air cushion to protect your feet from the impact of dancing in the streets.  The
                Marugo Kaisoku may offer a more sympathetic price, but take it from this festival participant - you don't want to be dancing all day in
                those thin soles.<br><br>
                
                For something more exciting than black or white, <a href="https://www.sousouus.com/product-category/tabi-shoes/split-toes-tabi-shoes/">Sou Sou US</a>
                offers tabi in exciting colors and patterns, some with the pattern within for personal enjoyment, and others with the patterns on the exterior
                for everyone to be amazed by your fashion sense.  Keep in mind, however, that these do not appear to be sold with the sole thickness specified, but
                the "Festival" line of shoes do seem to have a reasonably thick sole.<br><br>

                Naturally, one cannot wear normal socks with these shoes. Both websites offer split-toe socks for sale, with Samurai Market including a pair with
                each pair of shoes sold. Both double-split and 5-toe socks will work here, so wear what's comfortable!

                Yosakoi festival costumes are, for the most part, whatever you want them to be. Teams can be seen in traditional Japanese garb as well as salsa dresses,
                punk rock outfits, Princess Jasmine-esque costumes, and simply matching T-shirts.  What typically ties a team together is everyone wearing either one matching
                costume, or two complimentary costumes.<br><br>

                Costumes specifically intended for yosakoi festivals may be trickier to find in the US, but with the availability of third-party shipping companies, the lack
                of US storefronts is less an issue than ever.  That being said, most costumes are custom made for their teams, making it a bit more of a tricky issue
                with international buyers. There are, however, some off-the-rack makers out there, one of which being <a href="https://www.eventcreates.com/SHOP/54019/list.html">Event Creates</a> 
                (JP only).Using automatic translate from your web browser will definitely help here; be aware that the jackets seem to be sold separately from the pants, and do not
                include shoes.<br><br>

                Regardless of what costume you choose, remember to strongly consider how you will move in it, and how the material will feel against your skin as you dance 
                (e.g., a cheap plastic-y Halloween costume may not be your best friend for this application.)

                Quite literally essential for anyone to say they're dancing yosakoi. As the team often wears one costume style,
                they also typically match their naruko. Naruko are small, handheld, wooden clackers, with a slim grip, broad face, and 3 sticks
                that "clack" against the face with a flick of the wrist. After that basic form, they can be personalized in a myriad of ways, from the often-seen red base with
                black and yellow clackers, to glittery purple, to useful rubber grips, to the shape of a cute bear. <a href = "https://yosakoi-narukoya.co.jp/">Naruko-ya</a> (JP only) 
                is a store that specializes in naruko, and offers all of the above designs and more for whatever you want for your team. <br><br>

                Finding naruko in US stores is quite a bit trickier than ordering directly from Japan, as yosakoi is still relatively unknown and a skincare brand now uses
                the name Naruko. It's not impossible, however; searching "yosakoi naruko" or "yosakoi clappers" may pull some relevant searches out of the weeds, such as
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Yosakoi-Clapper-Naruko-2pcs/dp/B01J209B3K">this</a> example from Amazon.
