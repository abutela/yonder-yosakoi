                In the 1950s, the economy of Kochi, a castle-town in Shikoku in Western Japan, was doing about as well as anywhere else in the 
                nation at the time - not exceedingly well. A new dance called "yosakoi" was exhibited in 1950; in 1954, it was put forth that a
                festival featuring this new dance would help brighten the spirits of the townspeople, and bolster the economy as it did it. Eisaku
                Takemasa wrote a new song to put to the dance; based off a traditional song called "Yosakoi Bushi", the new song, "Yosakoi Naruko Odori"
                brought the lyrics to a new pace befitting a fun festival atmosphere. The first festival included 750 participants, and has continued growing.<br><br>
                When he arranged the festival song, Takemasa specified that it should have free copyright, allowing anyone to rearrange the music as they
                saw fit. Since its inception in 1954, the music heard at the Kochi festival encompasses many genres of music, including hip-hop, samba, rock,
                and reggae, as well as more traditional sounds. One rule of partipation at the Kochi festival specifies that any music used MUST incorporate
                Takemasa's original in some way, leading to all the music having a relative ribbon weaving them together, no matter how different they sound.<br><br>
                In 1992, a group of students from Hokkaido were entranced by the Kochi festival, and held the first Yosakoi-Soran festival in Sapporo, blending
                yosakoi with the Hokkaido native soran dance. This festival has grown to be nearly as large and popular as the Kochi festival, and since its
                inception, other cities and towns have followed to put on their own festivals.<br><br>
                Now, the dance in performed in festivals across the country, by dancers of all ages and abilities. Children's dance troupes may include children as young as 3, while retirees 
                may join in as a way to keep active. Special needs troupes can also be seen at the festivals, with caretakers and dependents working together. 
                Many high schools and colleges across the country feature yosakoi teams as an option for club life.<br><br>

                <h2>What's in a name?</h2>
                <p>
                    While it's not entirely clear, owing to a long and storied history, it's likely that the word "yosakoi" comes from the phrase "yosa, koi"("come at night.") Its
                usage for the dance comes from the folk song "Yosakoi Bushi", which tells the sad tale of a monk who had fallen in love with a beautiful woman,
                and was caught buying her a hair pin by the Harimaya Bridge in Kochi. "Yosakoi, yosakoi" in this context then likely means "come at night, come at night",
                owing to the secret nature of their relationship.
