                There are many yosakoi festivals, both in Japan and more recently internationally!
            </p>
            <p> 
                Are you itching to do more than just watch? Check out the <a href="/learn.html"> the steps of the original dance</a>,

            <h2>Japan</h2>
            <p> Naturally Japan is host to the most frequent, most reliable, and biggest yosakoi festivals. For anyone interested in yosakoi 
                or dance alone these festivals are a treat for the senses, often featuring hundreds of dancers in a rainbow of costumes and 
                any number of music styles, most or all of which featuring naruko(clackers) held in both hands. The original and best known 
                festival is the Kochi Yosakoi Matsuri(festival), though the Sapporo Yosakoi-Soran festival may certainly be a match in terms
                of sheer size. Multiple smaller festivals take place in towns and cities across the country.  If planning a visit to Japan in 
                the summer, one of these festivals should definitely be on your must-see list!</p>
                <ul class="visit">
                    <li><h3>Kochi Yosakoi Matsuri</h3><br>
                    Held in Kochi, on the island of Shikoku in southwestern Japan in August each year.<br> Visit

                    Held in Sapporo, on the northern island of Hokkaido in June of each year. This festival features
                    a fushion of yosakoi and native soran dance styles.<br> Visit

                    Note: It seems that COVID-19 may have derailed the festival, but due to its size and popularity I imagine it will be back soon!
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Nippon Domannaka Matsuri</h3><br>
                    Held in Nagoya, effectively the "dead center"("domannaka") of Japan. This festival is commonly known by its nickname, "Domatsuri". This festival is held at the end of August each year.<br> Visit

                    <li>Harajuku Omotesando Genki Matsuri Super Yosakoi<br>
                    Held in Harajuku in the heart of Tokyo, this festival is also held at the end of August each year. This is likely the most accessible festival for most travelers.<br> Visit

                    <li><h3>Koiya Matsuri</h3><br>
                    This festival is held in Osaka, Japan's second largest city, on the western shore of the main island, in the shadow of the world-famous Osaka Castle.  Unlike many of the other festivals, this one takes place in mid-September.<br>

            <h2>US</h2>
            <p>
            While there are no festivals dedicated to yosakoi (yet!), yosakoi may be seen at several cherry blossom festivals.</p>
                <ul class="visit">
                    <li>
                        <h3>Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival</h3><br>
                        San Francisco/Bay Area - April<br>
                        Check <a href="https://sfcherryblossom.org/">the official website</a> to learn more.

                    <li>
                        <h3>Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival</h3><br> 
                        New York City - April<br>
                        The Sakura Matsuri Festival does not have an official website detailing events.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Malaysia</h2>
            <p>
                Yosakoi performances are held in March of each year in Penang by the Pink Hibiscus Yosakoi Dancers as a way to strengthen the ties between Japan and Malaysia.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Vietnam</h2>
            <p>
                The Japan Sakura Matsuri is held each year in Hanoi and usually features yosakoi performances, with ten teams from Vietnam and Japan participating. Other Japanese-centric
                festivals, such as anime conventions, may also feature yosakoi.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Brazil</h2>
            <p>
                Sao Paolo is well known as the city with the highest density of Japanese culture outside of Japan owing to an influx of workers in the late 1800s.
                The city has occasionally held yosakoi festivals, though it is unclear (to the author) whether they are ongoing. In 2005 the festival was held in July.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                Groups and universities around the world, including the US, Canada, and across Europe may also have access to yosakoi teams, but do not have any specific festivals
                that they participate in.
