            <h1>Let's Visit a Yosakoi Festival!</h1>
            <p>
                There are many yosakoi festivals, both in Japan and more recently internationally!
            </p>
            <p class = "mobile"> 
                Are you itching to pull together a team and join in the fun? Check out the 
                <a href="rules.html">rules of participation</a> at the Kochi Yosakoi Festival!

            <h2>Japan</h2>
            <p> Naturally Japan is host to the most frequent, most reliable, and biggest yosakoi festivals. For anyone interested in yosakoi or dance alone these festivals 
                are a treat for the senses, often featuring hundreds of dancers in a rainbow of costumes and any number of music styles, most or all of which featuring naruko(clackers)
                held in both hands. The original and best known festival is the Kochi Yosakoi Matsuri(festival), though the Sapporo Yosakoi-Soran festival may certainly be a match in terms
                of sheer size. Multiple smaller festivals take place in towns and cities across the country.  If planning a visit to Japan in the summer, one of these festivals should 
                definitely be on your must-see list!
                <ul id="visit">
                    <li>Kochi Yosakoi Matsuri</li>

                        Note: It seems that COVID-19 may have derailed the festival, but due to its size and popularity I imagine it will be back soon!

            <h2>US</h2>
            <p>
            While there are no festivals dedicated to yosakoi (yet!), yosakoi may be seen at several cherry blossom festivals.
                <ul id="visit">
                    <li>Northern Cherry Blossom Festival (San Francisco/Bay Area) - April</li>
                    <li>Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival (New York City) - April</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Malaysia</h2>
            <p>
                Yosakoi performances are held in March of each year in Penang by the Pink Hibiscus Yosakoi Dancers as a way to strengthen the ties between Japan and Malaysia.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h2>Vietnam</h2>
            <p>
                The Japan Sakura Matsuri is held each year in Hanoi and usually features yosakoi performances, with ten teams from Vietnam and Japan participating. Other Japanese-centric
                festivals, such as anime conventions, may also feature yosakoi.
            </p>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>Brazil</h2>
            <p>
                Sao Paolo is well known as the city with the highest density of Japanese culture outside of Japan owing to an influx of workers in the late 1800s.
                The city has occasionally held yosakoi festivals, though it is unclear (to the author) whether they are ongoing. In 2005 the festival was held in July.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>
                Groups and universities around the world, including the US, Canada, and across Europe may also have access to yosakoi teams, but do not have any specific festivals
                that they participate in.
